### 2. Developer Guide (`/docs/arch-extended-patterns.md`)

**File Size**: 22,295 bytes
**Sections**: 6 major sections + code examples
**Content**:

#### Source-Generated Queries Section
- Basic usage with step-by-step instructions
- Query attributes explained (`[All]`, `[Any]`, `[None]`)
- Component parameter modifiers (`in`, `ref`)
- Performance characteristics comparison
- Generated code examples

#### CommandBuffer Pattern Section
- Problem statement (unsafe immediate changes)
- Solution with deferred execution
- Complete API reference:
  - Entity destruction
  - Entity creation
  - Component addition/removal
- Using statement auto-disposal
- Factory pattern integration
- Performance characteristics

#### System Lifecycle Section
- System base class structure
- Constructor requirements
- Dependency injection registration
- System execution order management

#### Common Pitfalls Section
5 critical pitfalls with ❌ wrong and ✅ correct examples:
1. Forgetting `partial` keyword
2. Wrong entity parameter modifier
3. Immediate structural changes during queries
4. Accessing entity before Playback
5. Forgetting `using` statement

#### Performance Optimization Section
4 optimization techniques:
1. Use source-generated queries (200 bytes saved per call)
2. Use `in` for read-only components (eliminates defensive copies)
3. Batch structural changes (better cache usage)
4. Filter early with `[None<T>]` (faster archetype filtering)

#### Code Examples Section
- Complete BattleSystem example (73 lines)
- Complete PlayerEntityFactory example (51 lines)
- Both examples fully annotated with migration status

**Best Practices Summary**:
- 8 "DO" recommendations
- 7 "DON'T" warnings
- Links to additional resources
