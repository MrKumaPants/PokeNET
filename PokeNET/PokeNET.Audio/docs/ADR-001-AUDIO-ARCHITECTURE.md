# ADR-001: Audio System Architecture Design

## Status
**ACCEPTED** - 2025-10-22

## Context
Phase 6 of PokeNET requires a comprehensive audio system that supports:
- Background music with smooth transitions
- Multiple simultaneous sound effects
- Procedural music generation
- Volume control and audio mixing
- Configuration management
- Future extensibility for 3D audio, streaming, and voice chat

The system must be maintainable, testable, and follow SOLID principles to ensure long-term viability.

## Decision

We will implement a **layered audio architecture** with seven core interfaces following SOLID principles:

### Architecture Layers

1. **Orchestration Layer** (IAudioManager)
   - Facade pattern for simplified API
   - Coordinates all subsystems
   - Enforces business rules (ducking, priority)

2. **Specialized Player Layer**
   - IMusicPlayer: Long-form audio with transitions
   - ISoundEffectPlayer: Short-duration multi-channel audio
   - IProceduralMusicGenerator: DryWetMidi-powered generation

3. **Foundation Layer**
   - IAudioService: Core playback control
   - IAudioMixer: Volume and channel management
   - IAudioConfiguration: Settings and validation

### Key Architectural Decisions

#### 1. Interface Segregation (ISP)
**Decision**: Separate music and sound effect interfaces instead of a unified player.

**Rationale**:
- Music requires looping, crossfading, transitions (IMusicPlayer)
- Sound effects require channel limits, priority, fire-and-forget (ISoundEffectPlayer)
- Combining these creates a bloated interface violating ISP
- Clients only depend on the methods they need

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Cleaner, focused interfaces
- ✅ Better testability
- ✅ Easier to extend independently
- ⚠️ More interfaces to implement

#### 2. Dependency Inversion (DIP)
**Decision**: IAudioManager depends on abstractions (IMusicPlayer, ISoundEffectPlayer), not implementations.

**Rationale**:
- Allows swapping implementations (OpenAL, XAudio2, NAudio, Web Audio API)
- Enables mocking for unit tests
- Supports future platform-specific implementations

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Highly testable
- ✅ Platform-agnostic
- ✅ Implementation flexibility
- ⚠️ Requires dependency injection setup

#### 3. Procedural Music as Separate Concern
**Decision**: IProceduralMusicGenerator is separate from IMusicPlayer.

**Rationale**:
- Procedural generation is optional (can be disabled via config)
- DryWetMidi integration is a specialized concern
- Keeps IMusicPlayer focused on playback, not generation
- Allows swapping generation algorithms independently

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Optional dependency on DryWetMidi
- ✅ Easier to extend with AI-based generation
- ✅ Cleaner separation of concerns
- ⚠️ Requires coordination between generator and player

#### 4. Event-Driven State Management
**Decision**: Use C# events for state changes, errors, and completions.

**Rationale**:
- Decouples components (Observer pattern)
- Supports reactive UI updates
- Enables logging and telemetry without coupling
- Allows multiple subscribers

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Loose coupling
- ✅ Extensible without modification (OCP)
- ✅ Easy to add logging/metrics
- ⚠️ Must manage event handler lifecycle to avoid memory leaks

#### 5. Configuration via Interface
**Decision**: IAudioConfiguration with typed properties + custom dictionary.

**Rationale**:
- Strongly-typed common settings (compile-time safety)
- Dictionary for custom settings (OCP)
- Load/save from JSON/XML
- Validation support

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Type-safe for common settings
- ✅ Extensible for custom needs
- ✅ Centralized configuration
- ⚠️ Must maintain validation logic

#### 6. Async/Await for I/O Operations
**Decision**: All file I/O and long-running operations are async.

**Rationale**:
- Non-blocking UI
- Better resource utilization
- Modern C# best practice
- Cancellation token support

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Responsive applications
- ✅ Cancellable operations
- ✅ Scalable
- ⚠️ Requires careful async/await usage

#### 7. Domain Models for Data Transfer
**Decision**: Dedicated models (AudioTrack, SoundEffect, MusicState) instead of primitives.

**Rationale**:
- Rich metadata (artist, mood, energy)
- Type safety (not passing strings everywhere)
- Easy to extend with new properties
- Better IDE support and refactoring

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Type-safe
- ✅ Self-documenting
- ✅ Extensible
- ⚠️ More code to write

## Consequences

### Positive
1. **Maintainability**: SOLID principles ensure code is easy to modify
2. **Testability**: Interfaces enable comprehensive unit testing
3. **Extensibility**: Open/Closed principle allows adding features without breaking changes
4. **Flexibility**: Dependency Inversion allows swapping implementations
5. **Clarity**: Single Responsibility makes each component's purpose clear
6. **Scalability**: Async operations and channel limits prevent resource exhaustion

### Negative
1. **Complexity**: More interfaces means more files and initial complexity
2. **Boilerplate**: Implementing all interfaces requires significant code
3. **Learning Curve**: Developers must understand SOLID principles
4. **Over-Engineering Risk**: Simple use cases might seem overdesigned

### Neutral
1. **Implementation Effort**: ~40 interface methods + 3 models + exceptions
2. **Testing Effort**: Each interface needs comprehensive test coverage
3. **Documentation Needs**: Interfaces require extensive XML documentation

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Single IAudioPlayer Interface
**Rejected**: Violates ISP, creates fat interface with unrelated methods.

### Alternative 2: Concrete Classes Without Interfaces
**Rejected**: Violates DIP, makes testing difficult, reduces flexibility.

### Alternative 3: Procedural Music in IMusicPlayer
**Rejected**: Violates SRP, couples playback with generation, makes DryWetMidi required.

### Alternative 4: Configuration via Static Class
**Rejected**: Not testable, violates DIP, global state issues.

## Compliance Verification

| SOLID Principle | Verification |
|-----------------|--------------|
| **SRP** | ✅ Each interface has ONE clear responsibility |
| **OCP** | ✅ Extensible via events, custom settings, polymorphism |
| **LSP** | ✅ IMusicPlayer extends IAudioService correctly |
| **ISP** | ✅ Small, focused interfaces (Music/SFX separate) |
| **DIP** | ✅ Manager depends on abstractions, not concretions |
