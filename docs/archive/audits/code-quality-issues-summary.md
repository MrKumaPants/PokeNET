## Top 5 Quick Wins (Can be fixed in < 1 hour each)

1. **Remove unused import** (PokeNETGame.cs:8)
   ```csharp
   // Delete: using static System.Net.Mime.MediaTypeNames;
   ```

2. **Fix inefficient loop** (PokeNETGame.cs:60-65)
   ```csharp
   var languages = new List<CultureInfo>(LocalizationManager.GetSupportedCultures());
   ```

3. **Extract magic numbers** (Multiple files)
   ```csharp
   private const int DEFAULT_MAX_CACHE_SIZE = 100;
   private const int HIGH_COMPLEXITY_THRESHOLD = 20;
   ```

4. **Add disposed flag** (HarmonyPatcher.cs:157)
   ```csharp
   private bool _disposed;
   public void Dispose()
   {
       if (_disposed) return;
       // ... cleanup
       _disposed = true;
   }
   ```

5. **Add ConfigureAwait(false)** (ModLoader.cs:166)
   ```csharp
   await modInstance.InitializeAsync(context, CancellationToken.None)
       .ConfigureAwait(false);
   ```

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests Needed
1. **ModLoader**: Test circular dependency detection
2. **ScriptCompilationCache**: Test thread safety and eviction
3. **AssetManager**: Test mod path changes and caching
4. **EventBus**: Test concurrent subscriptions/publications
5. **SecurityValidator**: Test all security rules

### Integration Tests Needed
1. **Mod Loading Pipeline**: End-to-end mod loading with dependencies
2. **Asset Override**: Test mod asset overriding base assets
3. **Harmony Patches**: Test patch application and removal
4. **Script Execution**: Test script compilation and execution
5. **Cancellation**: Test cancellation token propagation
