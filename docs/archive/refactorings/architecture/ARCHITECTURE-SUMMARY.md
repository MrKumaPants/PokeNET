## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Current State Analysis

```
PokeNET ECS (Arch 2.x)
‚îú‚îÄ Systems: Manual query creation per frame
‚îú‚îÄ Components: Well-designed structs
‚îú‚îÄ Queries: Allocated every update
‚îú‚îÄ Structural Changes: Immediate (unsafe)
‚îî‚îÄ Performance: 10K entities @ 60 FPS
```

**Pain Points:**
- 450KB/frame allocation from queries
- 12 GC collections/minute
- Archetype churn from immediate operations
- No relationship tracking
- Manual pooling scattered

### Target State

```
PokeNET ECS (Arch 2.x + Extended)
‚îú‚îÄ Systems: Cached QueryDescription
‚îú‚îÄ Components: Pooled where appropriate
‚îú‚îÄ Queries: Zero-allocation cached
‚îú‚îÄ Structural Changes: CommandBuffer deferred
‚îú‚îÄ Relationships: Built-in graph support
‚îî‚îÄ Performance: 100K entities @ 60 FPS
```

**Benefits:**
- 95KB/frame allocation (79% reduction)
- 3 GC collections/minute (75% reduction)
- Stable frame times, predictable performance
- Complex gameplay relationships enabled
- Standardized patterns

## üé® Design Patterns

### Enhanced System Pattern

```csharp
public class ExampleSystem : SystemBaseEnhanced
{
    public ExampleSystem(ILogger<ExampleSystem> logger)
        : base(logger) { }

    protected override void OnInitialize()
    {
        // Define queries once
        DefineQuery("movable", desc => desc
            .WithAll<Position, MovementState>()
            .WithNone<Frozen>());
    }

    protected override void OnUpdate(float deltaTime)
    {
        // Zero allocation query
        var query = GetQuery("movable");
        World.Query(in query, (ref Position pos) => {
            // Process entities
        });
    }
}
```

### CommandBuffer Pattern

```csharp
protected override void OnUpdate(float deltaTime)
{
    using var cmd = CreateCommandBuffer();

    var query = GetQuery("destroyable");
    World.Query(in query, (Entity entity, ref Health hp) => {
        if (hp.Current <= 0)
            cmd.Destroy(entity); // Safe!
    });

    // Auto-playback on Dispose
}
```

### Entity Relationship Pattern

```csharp
// Define relationships
public struct Owns { }
public struct HasMove { }

// Create relationships
Entity trainer = World.Create<Trainer>();
Entity pokemon = World.Create<PokemonData>();
World.AddRelationship<Owns>(trainer, pokemon);

// Query relationships
var party = World.GetRelationships<Owns>(trainer);
```
